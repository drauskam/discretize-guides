The <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper"/> is one of the best picks for players wanting to be more independent of their party. Due to large amounts of self-produced <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/>, <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/> and damage mitigation, it is good in parties where your teammates do not perform very well.

The <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper" /> has multiple offensive skill
options (<Control name="Pull" />, boon corruptions for <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain" />
, <Condition name="Blinded" />, <Condition name="Immobile" />, etc.) <Specialization
  name="Reaper"
  text="Power Reaper"
/> can modify itself to fit many given situations in fractals.

It benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

Situationally on some fights the <Item id="24836"/> setup can be better.

If you want to optimise this build with infusions you can run 14 <Item name="Mighty +9 Agony Infusion"/> and 4 <Item name="Precise +9 Agony Infusion"/>, with a <Item id="48081" text="Berserkers Helm"/>.

In organized play the <Item id="24836"/> setup will outperform the <Item id="24723"/> setup on Skorvald, Arstariiv and the first two phases of Ensolyss.

Besides of cleave in T4 fractals, Arstariiv is the only encounter where it is optimal to play with <Item id="24618"/> instead of <Item id="24868"/>.

### Situational Weapons

- You can play with Axe/Warhorn on single target encounters with the need of additional defiance bar damage, utilising  <Skill name="Wail of Doom" /> (Warhorn 4).
- On <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain" /> encounters Axe/Focus can generate a damage increase by stripping boons with  <Skill name="Spinal Shivers" /> (Focus 5), but generally speaking <Skill name="Corrupt Boon" /> (Utility) can be used on both weaponsets and does not require adjusting the gear.

<Divider text="Rotation / Skill Usage" />
### Notes

The given rotation below is meant for a golem-like scenario and has to be adapted based on phase-lengths/mechanics/the following aspects: 
- Below 50% boss HP: <Skill name="Gravedigger" /> (Greatsword 2) replaces  <Skill name="Death Spiral" /> (Greatsword 3) and Greatsword auto-attacks. 
 Cancel the aftercasts with any other skill or weaponswap (shroud works as well) or simply by pressing auto-attack in between two casts. Also skip one Auto-attack chain at the end of your Greatsword shroud loop.
- Below 25% boss HP: use <Skill name="Executioner's Scythe" /> (Shroud 5).
- All shouts require to stand in melee range (240 range) to get their full value.
- <Skill name="Deaths Charge" /> (Shroud 2) only deals slightly more damage compared to shroud auto-attacks.
- <Skill name="Infusing Terror" /> (first instance of shroud 3) should always be utilised during shroud to prevent getting interrupted and to reduce the loss of life force from incomming damage for 6s. 
Keep in mind that <Skill name="Terrify" /> (second instance of shroud 3) ends the damage mitigation and can interrupt e.g. <Skill name="Soul Spiral" /> (Shroud 4), so be careful to not double cast it by accident.

### Precasting

- Staff marks if possible (check the notes section).
- If you have <Skill name="Mistfire Wolf" /> (Deluxe Upgrade) precast it on MAMA, Siax and Ensolyss (then put back <Skill name="Lich Form"/>) since you are too far away from _Mistlock Singularity_ to make use of <Skill name="Lich Form" disableText/> precast.
- Optional: Precast <Skill name="Rise" /> (Utility) and swap back to <Skill name="You are all Weaklings!" />.
- Use <Skill name="Lich Form"/> (Elite) to precast <Skill id="10636"/> (Skill 4).

#### Staff Marks

- On Skorvald/Arkk/Siax phase 1 the direct hit damage does not connect, but you will still apply conditions and combo- fields/finishers, as well as getting life force from <Trait name="Soul Marks"/>, which can especially be useful during the orb phases of Ensolyss.
- For Arstariiv phase 1 they can be precasted into her jumping path.
- At MAMA you place them onto the spawn area of the first knight.
- To be able to precast them into Ensolyss phase 1, they need to be slighty below the initial hitbox.
